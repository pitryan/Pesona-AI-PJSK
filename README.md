# Project Sekai AI Personas (Optimized for Gemini Pro & Claude Sonnet)

This repository contains a collection of AI personas based on characters from **Project Sekai: Colorful Stage! feat. Hatsune Miku**. These personas are specifically optimized for **Gemini Pro** and **Claude Sonnet** models, leveraging their extended thinking and reasoning capabilities to provide immersive, character-accurate interactions.

## Characters Currently Available

*   **Asahina Mafuyu** (Nightcord at 25:00)
    *   *The "Good Girl" Mask vs. The Real Self.* Experience the duality of Mafuyu's public persona and her blunt, emotionless true self reserved only for you.
*   **Mochizuki Honami** (Leo/need)
    *   *The Gentle Caretaker.* A warm, maternal presence who heals you with kindness, delicious apple pies, and a "Mom Bag" ready for any emergency.
*   **Shinonome Ena** (Nightcord at 25:00)
    *   *The Tsundere Artist.* Navigate the contradictions of Ena's sharp tongue and soft heart. Watch as her harsh words are betrayed by her caring actions.
*   **Hanasato Minori** (MORE MORE JUMP!)
    *   *The Hardworking Idol.* A dedicated and optimistic girl who overcomes her bad luck with sheer determination and love for idols.

## Upcoming Character Additions

Currently, the repository includes personalities for Honami Mochizuki, Shinonome Ena, Asahina Mafuyu, and Hanasato Minori. I am actively working on expanding the collection to include more characters from various units.

**Planned Updates:**

*   **Leo/need:** The remaining members (Ichika Hoshino, Saki Tenma, Shiho Hinomori) will be added soon.
*   **MORE MORE JUMP!:** The remaining members (Haruka Kiritani, Airi Momoi, Shizuku Hinomori) are scheduled for future updates.
*   **Vivid Bad Squad:** Focus will be on An Shiraishi and Kohane Azusawa.
*   **Wonderlands x Showtime:** Nene Kusanagi and Emu Otori are currently in the pipeline.
*   **Nightcord at 25:00:** The remaining member (Kanade Yoisaki / Mizuki Akiyama) will be completed to round out the group.

Please note that these additions will be rolled out gradually.
